    <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <div class="abouthttp">
      <h2>HTTP</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, saw wide adoption
          in the early 1990s to facilitate this, transferring “hypertext”
          documents.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          This version was elegant and simple for the needs of the mid-90s web –
          make a connection, download a file, close the connection, and repeat
          for each file needed to display a web page.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The web was rapidly evolving and people wanted to watch videos and
          edit documents from their browsers.one file was quite slow for these
          new use-cases.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="http1">
      <h2>HTTP1.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          So, in 1999, the w3 overseeing body updated the HTTP spec to version
          1.1. Adding features to the 1.0 specification meant to improve the
          speed and efficiency of web servers powering this new “hypermedia”
          version of the web.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          As I’m sure you’re aware, the web changed a whole lot more between
          1999 and 2015 than it did between 1996 and 1999, but for those 16
          years we lived HTTP/1.1 specification
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The breaking point in HTTP/1.1 was reached well before the 2015
          introduction of HTTP/2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="http2">
        <h2>HTTP2</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Google was working on it’s own replacement for HTTP/1.1 since the
            early 2010s, called SPDY, SPDY used multiplexing to download
            multiple resources efficiently over a single connection, and could
            be “back-ported” to existing applications with a translation layer.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 2015, w3 officially adopted the HTTP/2 specification based on
            SPDY, and all major browsers began supporting the protocol.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Today, the concept of “webpages” is anachronistic,Modern websites
            function much more like applications, with a constant two-way stream
            of data being an essential part of their functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
